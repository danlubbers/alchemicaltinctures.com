        All of the Turkey Tails foraged are away from major interstates, roads
        or highways and found in dense forested areas where the climate is
        thriving. Only the fresh Turkey Tails are taken with white bottoms and I
        never harvest more than 50% of what is found on any given particular
        tree so that the ecosystem can thrive and be sustainable. More often
        than not, I am leaving what I find in the forest. A few times I’ve found
        fresh fungi with little slugs, caterpillars, etc on them and I will
        always leave those behind. I love seeing them munch on fungi. I put all
        that are collected in a netted bag and it’s tied to the outside of my
        pack so the spores disperse as I continue to hike around.

        Turkey Tail is one of the most-studied beneficial mushrooms. It
        invigorates immune cells while simultaneously making sure the immune
        response doesn’t overreact. As a prebiotic food for our probiotic
        microflora, it has also shown to improve the gut microbiome.
