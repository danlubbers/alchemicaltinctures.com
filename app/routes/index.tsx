        I call these “small batch” because this is a fun hobby of mine and the
        purpose was to get enough to boost up my immune system and gut health.
        From my first batch, I had extra which I gifted to some friends. Those
        friends reached back out later inquiring about more for themselves and
        some for their friends, which prompted me to design and create labels
        and that’s how “Alchemical Tinctures” was started. This is still a side
        project/hobby to stay healthy and keep my friends and whomever purchases
        a bottle on the healing path. When I run out, I run out, until it's
        season and I have time to forage more. Each batch shows the general
        location where they were harvested as well as the Alchemy Date.
